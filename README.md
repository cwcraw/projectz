This was an opportunity for me to work on my frontend skills and play around with the unSplash API. The "Cats-ta-gram" header was inspired by my work in the semiconductor industry. I would joke that we have the worlds smartest people working tirelessly to make sure you can always look at a cat - on your cellphone. 
## Technologies Used
The frontend was implemented with Vue using Vuex to manage state. I also used Vuex-bootstrap to create the popover windows for bookmarking photos. I used Vue because I was somewhat familiar with it and appreciate its tripartite layout of Template, Script and Style. Also, I knew that Vuex would be an easy way to manage state and allow me to get an idea of how I would want to layout the database in the future. 

Although I started working on the backend, currently this is a frontend only project.

## Project setup
Before starting make sure you have an unSplash account and an access key added to your .env file. Set the access key equal to VUE_APP_ACCESS_KEY.

To start the frontend clone the repo and run:
```
yarn install
```
and then:
```
yarn serve
```
This will put you in development mode, which is appropriate as this is still a work in progress.
